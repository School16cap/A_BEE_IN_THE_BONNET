It was considered a kind of dushegrei, sewn with a lining, quilted on cotton wool or tow, from expensive purchased materials — silk, velvet, corduroy, brocade — and decorated with strips of braid, fringe of metal thread and fur fringe. On the back, the epanechka was collected in large tubular folds-burs. In different counties, it was called kholodnik or kaftanchik and was known even in the XVI—XVII centuries, then it was worn by women and girls only from boyar and merchant families. Later, the epanechka became a detail of the city costume of merchants and rich middle-class women. In the peasant environment, it was quite rare, mainly in rich families who lived in suburban, commercial and artisan villages. The popularity of epanechka among women of the Nizhny Novgorod province is explained by the trade and profitable trades developed in this region.

Festive versions of it in the XVIII century were made of expensive silks and decorated with a long row of puffed buttons on the front.
